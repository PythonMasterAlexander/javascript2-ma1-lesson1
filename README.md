Lesson Task 1 Question

Make a request to the following API endpoint:
https://www.breakingbadapi.com/api/characters

Display a loading indicator while the call is in progress.

Display the name, birthday and nickname properties as well as each occupation as a tag (an inline element like a span).

Display only the first 7 items.

In this code I show how to make a loader, use as a reference next time I need to make api loaders.

In this code I show how to use break keyword to stopp the loop after a given time of displays, depending on what you need. Use this as a reference next time I need to do this. 

Improve Code
Make use of createElement() and do not create html with string literals. This can 
cause vulnerabilities in the code that can be explotate by somebody. 

Fix issue with the second loop. If I could get the occupation api call together with the firs loop somehow.
